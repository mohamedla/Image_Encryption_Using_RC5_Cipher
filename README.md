Encryption_Image_Using_RC5_Cipher is am GUI application made in python tkinter for encrypt and decrypt images as blocks using 2 modes ECB CBC

To run this app you must have Pyhton  on your device (I have Python 3.9.1)

  and install couple of packges (used python pip to do it)

      terminal command :
      
        pip insall pillow
        
        pip insall numpy==1.19.3
        
Now you ready to run the app

  just run from images.py file using your terminall or any editor you prefer that suports Python
  
Enjoy ;)



Problems : this app have big problem in running time especially the you try to proccess a large image or incresing the round number

defult values : key = pig , mode = ECB , rounds = 12, block size = 32
